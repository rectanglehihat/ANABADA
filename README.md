# 🤜 Delete 기능 완성 버전입니다~!

### ./redux/modules/card.js
이전 심화주차때의 post모듈이라고 생각하시면 될 것 같습니다 :) 포스트 하나하나 추가, 삭제, 수정하던 곳이요!  deletePost, deletePostDB를 중심으로 보시면 됩니다.

### ./components/Card.js
이전 심화주차때의 Post컴포넌트 역할을 하는 친구입니다. 삭제하기 버튼에 onclick 먹인거 중심으로 보시면 될 것 같아요!

그리고 **꼭!** configureStore에서 rootReducer로 묶어주기!


제가 git을 잘몰라서ㅎㅎㅎ 저같은 경우엔 그냥 안전하게 zip파일로 다운받고     
yarn install로 모든 라이브러리 한번에 설치 진행 후 yarn start 하니 3000포트 잘 떴습니다!

기능구현을 많이 하진 않았지만 일단 게시글 삭제부분은 어제 민영 튜터님과 함께 진행했으니 한번 참고 하시면 좋을거 같아요 :)

포기하지 말고 우리 모두 화이탱~!~!




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
